This project is for generating call trees for fortran projects(requires graphviz and python)

It is not yet mature. Does not consider functions and may fail in some 
nasty cases. Also it does not go recursively into the directories while scans 
source folder. 

package gui - contains my tries of the python Tkinter, I thought maybe generating
a tree from the sources, which can be collapsed and expanded as necessary with, maybe search 
possibilities. Also it would be great to add a feature "show source" of a selected node.
